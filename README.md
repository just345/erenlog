1. ERENLOG MAKER.bat
                                            THIS IS ONLY THE MAKER PART SO YOU RUN IT AND ENTER YOUR WEBHOOK URL, SO IT ISNT THE ACTUAL STUFF
                                            is coded in batch so the file is the code as well
                                            check the code for malware before using i guess
                                            NOTE: dont buy this  it is free
                                            NOTE 2: i didnt fully code this i took it from a polish youtube channel but the code was not working AND i coded the enter webhook part and the part where it generates another batch file, so to put it in a nutshell i coded the maker part and perfected the actual malware
